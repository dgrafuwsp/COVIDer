# COVIDer
# The purpose of these Python scripts are to parse and reduce the copious
# COVID data provided by the NY Times and The Atlantic into state- and
# county- specific datasets that can be analyzed by students to compare 
# doubling-rates, r, cases per 100 000, death rates, etc. and generally
# learn to analyze larger datasets without having to parse the larger
# original data files.

# The files that end in .py are the scripts to update and parse the data. 
# Two directories need to exist in the same directory as the Python
# scripts: /csv_data and /covid_data.

# The file that ends in .csv is the census data used to get population
# for the counties. It can be manually placed in the /csv_data
# directory.

# The files that end in .txt are sample tab-delimited data files that
# are created from the downloaded data.
